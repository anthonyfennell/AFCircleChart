# AFCircleChart

A circular chart displayed as a percentage of coverage over a circle. 
A label showing the values of the graph are displayed in the center of the chart.
Underneath is another label displaying a string describing the contents of the 
graph. The design of this chart is based off Nuwe's dial charts design, but this is
my own representation in order to show the cooresponding data that I need.

This is a demo application that shows how to produce the dial chart and shows
a few variations of how to re-animate the chart while giving it different values.
