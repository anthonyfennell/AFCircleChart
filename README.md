# AFCircleChart

A circular chart displayed as a percentage of coverage over a circle. 
A label showing the values of the graph are displayed in the center of the chart.
Underneath is another label displaying a string describing the contents of the 
graph. Circular width and colors are able to be changed.

This is a demo application that shows how to produce the dial chart and shows
a few variations of how to re-animate the chart while giving it different values.
